 The Skinny
 ----------

 There is no good news for anyone looking for a trip to the reef. The BOM is forecasting 10 to 15 knots over the next three days. Bouywether has swells below a metre today and tomorrow but swells are are only 4 seconds apart. Beyond the Cape it is sure to be bumpy.

 There were a few boats heading to the ramp early this morning but I am guessing they are not going far. This is picture from Jezzine Barracks.

 I have included the tides in case you are thinking about the creeks.
