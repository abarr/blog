 The Skinny
 ----------

 Well, last weeks post was off by a long shot with seas never getting over half a metre. The winds held off and judging by the trailers at the boat ramp car-park plenty of people gave it a shot over the weekend and right through to Tuesday. This picture was taken on Tuesday morning from the Rockpool.

 Looking ahead for the next seven days it seems pretty bleak. Below is the forecast for Davies Reef from Bouyweather which has seas close to 2 metres from tomorrow (BoM is the same).

 The difference this week is the tides and moon are favourable so a bit a creek action might be the go.

 Chewin' the Fat
 ---------------

 I had hoped to have a video this week showing how to make a beer can popper. Unfortunately, I didn't have a beer to hand so like a trooper grabbed a coldie from the fridge and one thing led to another. Now I have plenty of beer cans but no lure. Attempt number two this weekend.
