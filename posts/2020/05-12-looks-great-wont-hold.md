 The Skinny
 ----------

 I was on The Strand this morning, and it was picture perfect. It was glassing out in the bay, and a few boats were heading out. It was almost enough for me to wipe the dust of Mojo and go for a spin.

 However, a quick check of the weather confirmed it would have been a short trip. From tomorrow seas are back to one metre at seven-second intervals.

 Tides and moon are not favourable until late next week, but the current long-range forecast does not look promising. Let's all keep everything crossed and hope for a change.

 Chewin' the Fat
 ---------------

 We have been moving over to a new system for the last few weeks (Slowed down by the kids all being at home!).  No doubt there will be some kinks to iron out, but the plan is to go back to the weekly email from today. Next week we will be trying something new, so be sure to check your email on Wednesday.

 Please don't forget to share the link with everyone you know to follow us on all the socials.
