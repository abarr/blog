 The Skinny
 ----------

 It looks like at least another week of strong winds and rough seas. The BoM has issued a strong wind warning for tomorrow, predicting winds of up to 30 knots and seas increasing to 2.5m. The forecast for Davies Reef from Bouyweather is predicting much the same for next week.

 After some rain last weekend and with some predicted it might be an opportunity to hit the creeks and see if the Muddies are on the move.
