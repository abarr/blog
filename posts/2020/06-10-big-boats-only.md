 The Skinny
 ----------

 Weather is typical for this time of the year, BoM is forecasting a southeasterly between 15 and 20 knots with swells 1-2 metres. I don't have a picture this week, but as usual, the view of calm waters in the bay only gives false hope for a trip out wide. Below is the forecast for Davies Reef from Bouywesther.

 There is still a bit of run so the creeks might provide a bit of action if that is your go.

 Chewin' the Fat
 ---------------

My last trip out to Davies there was a heap of run, and I wanted to keep the bait up and swinging in the current. I found this video with a Poternoster Rig that twisted the tag lines to give them some stiffness. They take a bit longer to rig up but well worth the effort if you are swinging around and bouncing your sinker. I recommend giving it a go.
